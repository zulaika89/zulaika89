I am Zulaika Nur, a cybersecurity professional with a unique background in entrepreneurship and design. For over 10 years, I ran a successful business in henna artistry, wedding dresses, and custom clothing, an experience that sharpened my eye for detail, strengthened my multitasking skills, and taught me the value of precision. I also have experience in Fraud research analyst  and Tech Support for several companies.
My passion for cybersecurity grew from curiosity about how systems work and how they can be protected.
